## Trust Boundaries

### Network Trust Boundaries

1. **Internet → API Gateway**
   - HTTPS/TLS 1.3 termination
   - DDoS protection and rate limiting
   - WAF (Web Application Firewall)
   - Geographic filtering

2. **API Gateway → Application Layer**
   - Internal network (VPC/Private subnet)
   - mTLS between services
   - Network policies restrict cross-service communication

3. **Application Layer → Data Layer**
   - Database network isolation
   - Connection pooling with authentication
   - Encrypted connections (TLS)
   - Credential rotation from Vault

4. **Application Layer → External Services**
   - OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect flows
   - API key management through Vault
   - Certificate-based authentication
   - Network egress filtering

5. **ADB Manager → Device Lab**
   - Isolated device lab network (192.168.1.0/24)
   - ADB over TCP with authentication
   - Device certificate-based trust

### Security Trust Levels

- **Level 0 (Public)**: Web dashboard, public APIs
- **Level 1 (Authenticated)**: User-specific data and operations
- **Level 2 (Privileged)**: Admin operations, device management
- **Level 3 (System)**: Internal service communication, database access
- **Level 4 (Critical)**: Vault secrets, device lab access, external integrations
